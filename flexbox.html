            <h2 id="about">About Miffy</h2>
            <p>Miffy (Dutch: Nijntje, pronounced [ˈnɛiɲcə]) is a small female rabbit in a series of picture books drawn
                and written by Dutch artist Dick Bruna. The original Dutch name, "Nijntje", is a shortening of the
                diminutive konijntje, "little rabbit".

                The first Miffy book was produced in 1953, and almost 30 others have followed. In total they have sold
                over 85 million copies, and led to two separate television series as well as items such as clothes and
                toys featuring the character. A feature-length film, Miffy the Movie, was released on 30 January 2013.

                Four television series based on the character have been produced: Dick Bruna's Miffy Storybook Classics:
                The Original Series, which ran from January 1, 1984 until December 31, 1992 on PBS in the United States,
                Miffy: Colors, Numbers, and Shapes, which ran January 1, 1996 until December 31, 1996 on Cartoon Network
                in the United States, Miffy and Friends, which ran from April 7, 2003 until August 10, 2006 on Noggin in
                the United States, and Miffy's Adventures Big and Small, which premiered 2 October 2015 on Nick Jr. in
                the United States.</p>

            <h2 id="history">History</h2>
            <p>Miffy was created in 1953 after Bruna had been telling his one-year-old son, Sierk, stories about a
                little rabbit they had seen earlier in the dunes, while on holiday at Egmond aan Zee. Miffy became a
                female after Bruna decided that he wanted to draw a dress and not trousers on his rabbit. Depending on
                the story, Miffy can range in age from being a baby to being four years old.

                At first Miffy looked like a toy animal with floppy ears, but by 1963, her design was changed to her
                current incarnation, a stylized form of a rabbit. Miffy is drawn in a graphic style, with minimalist
                black graphic lines. Bruna chose to only use black, white, the primary colors (red, yellow and blue),
                green, orange, brown, and gray. It is his use of primarily primary colors that makes Miffy instantly
                recognisable, and also popular with preschoolers, because of her bright and intense simplistic colors.

                There are now almost 32 Miffy titles and many more for the other characters. Bruna has produced a total
                of 124 picture books for children. The Miffy books each contain twelve pages of story. Each page has one
                illustration and four lines of verse, the last word of the second line rhymes with the last of the
                fourth. They are written about things that children can understand, and situations they will face such
                as going to the hospital and going to school, and they always have a happy ending. Some books have no
                text at all, such as Miffy's Dream.

                The books are printed in small format. Bruna considers it important that his audience feels that his
                books are there for them, not for their parents. Most Miffy books have an advisory reading level of age
                4 to 8 years.</p>
