                <p>Musti is a cartoon character, created by Flemish Belgian graphic artist Ray Goossens.

                    Musti is a little 4-year-old kitten, living with his mother and father in a little house in a rural
                    village, surrounded by a large garden with animals and trees. Musti's mouth is represented as an
                    x. Musti was first created in 1969. The character has been featured in animated TV series since
                    then.</p>
                <h3 id="series">Television series</h3>
                <p>In 1969, Musti was developed into an animated series. In every episode, a specific story is told in a
                    couple of minutes. The subjects are always linked to the world of small children, combining
                    anthropomorphic animals and realistic situations. This series was first broadcast on Flemish
                    television, with Rachel Frederix as narrator. In the Netherlands, Musti appeared on television in
                    1980. The narrators were Arnold Gelderman and Marijke Merckens. In the 1990s a second series was
                    made, with a white background, with Musti's original pronunciation, Muh-sti, now changed to Moo-sti.
                    In total, 156 episodes have been made, airing in two dozen countries.

                    In 2007, a new television series was created. Instead of flat 2D images with a white background, the
                    new series is entirely rendered in 3D. The narrator is Kristel Van Craen. It airs in Belgium, the
                    Netherlands, Israel, Norway, Japan, Croatia, Portugal and the United States on BabyFirst TV.
                    Al-Jazeera aired the series throughout the Arabic world.</p>
                <h3 id="books">Books</h3>
                <p>The Flemish publisher Standaard Uitgeverij carries an extensive portfolio of Musti children's books,
                    targeting children aged 3–6.

                    Dupuis printed a number of Musti children's comics in French, based on the character's appearances
                    in the magazine Bonne Soirée.</p>
                <h3 id="software">Software </h3>
                <p>Educational software programs have been developed with Musti as the lead character developed by
                    Stefan Bracke.

                    They are currently only available in Dutch.</p>
