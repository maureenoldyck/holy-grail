            <h2 id="about">About Hopla</h2>
            <p>Hopla is a Belgian CGI-animated series for toddlers, created by Bert Smets in 1999, and produced by Bert
                Smets Productions.[1] The cartoon features the rabbit Hopla and his friends – the pig Onki, the bear
                Nina, and the kitten Lola. Each episode is about five minutes. Similar to its spiritual predecessor
                Tik Tak, the show is aimed at children between 20–24 months old and has no dialogue (the only dialogue
                is the show's name). The show was animated with Strata 3D.

                This animated series creates a colorful, recognizable and familiar world for toddlers and preschoolers.
                The subjects covered are also clearly recognizable: the playground, celebrating, being sick, staying,
                playing together, ... The characters in Hopla don't talk. In this way the children can respond with
                their own words to what they see on the screen. </p>



                <h2 id="history">History</h2>
                <p>The show first aired on Ketnet, a Flemish television channel, in 2000, and became popular soon
                    afterward. Hopla has been aired in 31 countries (including Belgium, Canada, Finland, France, Israel,
                    Japan, Poland, Portugal, South Korea, Turkey and the United States). In Belgium, Hopla's home
                    entertainment titles have sold over 300,000 copies and their book-related merchandise has garnered
                    sales
                    close to 700,000. In Portugal, the show aired on public channel RTP2, with some
                    dialogue added to briefly describe each scene's contents.

                    It airs in the United States due to an exclusive multi-year distribution deal between Bert Smets
                    Productions and NCircle Entertainment, a subsidiary of Alliance Entertainment, signed in 2007. The
                    show
                    was aired on BabyFirstTV.</p>
